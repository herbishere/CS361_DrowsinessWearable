# CS361_DrowsinessWearable
Following the Agile Process, the code in this repo was created via Pair Programming. This project describes aspects of a drowsiness wearable.

Since our application runs on local databases, there is no hosted URL to view the application. Instead, the code and application data will need to be downloaded using the steps below.
You can download the program at: https://github.com/herbishere/CS361_DrowsinessWearable
To install and run the program (on Windows):

Download and install the following Python libraries:

`flask`

`flask_bootstrap`

`flask_sqlalchemy`

`flask_migrate`

`flask_wtf`

`wtforms`

`flask_table`

`bs4`

Initialize the local database by running:

`flask db init`

`flask db migrate`

`flask db upgrade`

`python insert.py`

Run the application using `flask run`

Open and inspect the page, Toggling the Device Toolbar
